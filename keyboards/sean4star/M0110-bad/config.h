/*	Note that adding a diode at a previously unused intersection will effectively tell the firmware that there is a key held down at that point. You can
	instruct qmk to ignore that intersection by defining MATRIX_MASKED and then defining a matrix_row_t matrix_mask[MATRIX_ROWS] array in
	your keyboard config. Each bit of a single value (starting form the least-significant bit) is used to tell qmk whether or not to pay attention to key
	presses at that intersection.
	
	While MATRIX_MASKED isnâ€™t necessary to use SPLIT_HAND_MATRIX_GRID successfully, without it you may experience issues trying to suspend your
	computer with your keyboard attached as the matrix will always report at least one key-press.
